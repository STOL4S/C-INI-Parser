# C++ INI File Parser
This project contains the source code and compiled .lib for the INIFile class. 
The INIFile class is a data structure that allows for loading and saving of .ini files. 
Once a file is loaded into memory, it's variables can be read or modified and then saved to file again.
Most function calls return custom HRESULTs for easy debugging of any errors that may occur.
The goal is to make a compact .ini file reader and writer that anyone can use in their project.
