# C++ INI File Processor
  This project contains a class, INIFile, and a test environment for this class.
The INIFile class is a data structure that allows for easy loading and saving
of .ini file types. Once a .ini file is loaded into memory, its variables/values
can be read or modified and then saved again to the harddrive. This class aims
to make it easier for C++ programmers to load/save settings to file that can
also be changed by the end user, without need for Windows resource files.
